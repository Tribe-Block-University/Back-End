## Introduction to ExpressJS

ExpressJS is a fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js that allows you to build web applications and APIs with ease. It is widely used for building server-side applications in Node.js and is the foundation for many popular web frameworks.

For more information on ExpressJS, you can refer to the [official documentation](https://expressjs.com/).

# Setting Up Your Project

### 1. Install Node.js and NPM
Before you begin, ensure you have **Node.js** and **npm** (Node Package Manager) installed. You can download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

To check if Node.js and npm are installed, run the following commands in your terminal:
```bash
node -v
npm -v

## Initialize a New Project
Create a new directory for your project and initialize it using npm:
```red
mkdir my-express-app
cd my-express-app
npm init -y
```
## Install Express
Now, install ExpressJS as a dependency:
```
npm install express
```
## Create Your First Express App
Create a file named app.js in your project directory:

## app.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});

## Run the App
### Start your application:
```
node app.js
```
Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the result.
